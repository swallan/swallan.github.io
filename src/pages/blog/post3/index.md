## Overview 

I was originally hired at the Cal Poly Corporation in the Marketing and Communications department to help them with their technology aparatus, but after they learned that I was a Software Engineering major, I was also able to take on the role of Student Web Developer. As a result of coronavirus impacts to their business, I was furloughed in March 2020, but as of Fall 2020, have resumed employment.


This meant working on their two websites; calpolydining.com and calpolycorporation.org. At first, I started with easier tasks like updating content and adding images, and then moved on to more advanced improvements. A few of the projects that I have worked on that were meaningful were 

- adding dynamic generation for image galleries
- sitewide speed improvements (image compression, removing uneeded extra processes.)
- Airtable configuration for propogation of holiday and non standard hours to the dining website and for easier export to google business.
